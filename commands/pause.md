# Pause Session

## Step 1: Gather Current State

Collect information about the current session:

### Active Work
- Current task/issue being worked on
- Files currently being modified
- Progress percentage

### Session Context
- When session started
- What was accomplished
- What's in progress
- What was planned but not started
- Astro docs consulted during session

### Open Items
- Uncommitted changes (check `git status`)
- Failing tests or build issues
- Questions that need answers

---

## Step 2: Capture Project State (via astro-mcp)

Query current project state for handoff:

```markdown
### Project Snapshot

#### Configuration (via get-astro-config)
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Astro Version | [version] |
| Output Mode | [mode] |
| Integrations | [count] |

#### Routes (via list-astro-routes)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Routes | X |
| Static | X |
| Dynamic | X |
| API | X |

#### Recently Modified Files
[From git status and recent commits]
```

---

## Step 3: Check for Uncommitted Work

```bash
git status
```

If there are uncommitted changes:
```markdown
⚠️ **Uncommitted Changes Detected**

Files modified:
- [list files]

Options:
1. **Commit now** - Save changes before pausing
2. **Stash** - Temporarily store changes
3. **Leave as-is** - Resume will see dirty state

Recommended: Option 1 (commit) for clean handoff.
```

Wait for decision, then proceed.

---

## Step 4: Generate Handoff Document

Create `.planning/HANDOFF.md`:

```markdown
# Session Handoff

**Paused:** {{TIMESTAMP}}
**By:** Claude Code Session
**Project:** {{PROJECT_NAME}}
