## 1. Install (30 seconds)

```bash
cd your-astro-project

# One-line install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/astro-seo-agency/main/install.sh | bash
```

## 2. Open in Claude Code

Launch VS Code with Claude Code extension, or use Claude Code CLI.

## 3. Start Working

```bash
# See your priorities

## That's It!

Analytics configuration is optional. The plugin works great without it.

## Optional: Add Analytics

For traffic-based prioritization, add to `.env`:

```env
GA_PROPERTY_ID=123456789
GSC_SITE_URL=https://your-site.com/
```

Then `/start` will show traffic data and rank issues by impact.
